# EC2 Dynamic Scheduler

This AWS CloudFormation stack resizes EC2 instances on a schedule to optimize compute costs for business-hours workloads. It scales instances down during off-hours and scales them back up before the next business day. This allows you to reduce spend without shutting down systems or triggering alerts from monitoring tools.

## üîß How It Works

- A Lambda function runs twice per day via EventBridge rules:
  - **7 PM Pacific** ‚Äî Scales down tagged instances to a smaller type (e.g. `t3.medium`)
  - **4 AM Pacific (Mon‚ÄìFri only)** ‚Äî Scales them back up to the original size
- Instances are rebooted once per resize operation (stop ‚Üí modify ‚Üí start)
- This works even if you're using Compute Savings Plans
- Minimal impact to existing tools, monitoring agents, or workflows
- Each scale-down run estimates the discounted hourly savings per instance (respecting any configured Compute Savings Plan discount), stores a JSON report in an S3 bucket for cost tracking, and emits the totals to a CloudWatch Metrics namespace so you can build dashboards or alarms

## üè∑Ô∏è Required EC2 Tags

Apply these tags to any EC2 instance you want managed by this scheduler:

| Tag Key                 | Tag Value            | Purpose                                           |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `DynamicInstanceScaling` | `true`               | Opts the instance into scheduling                 |
| `PreferredInstanceType`  | `m7i.large` (example) | Specifies the instance type to return to at 4 AM |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The instance type will be resized to `t3.medium` by default during off-hours.

## üîê IAM Permissions

The Lambda function follows a least privilege model. It can only modify EC2 instances with the `DynamicInstanceScaling=true` tag. It also has scoped access to:

- Start/stop/modify EC2 instances
- Create EBS volume grants (for encrypted volumes)
- Write logs to CloudWatch Logs (14-day retention)
- Write savings reports to an S3 bucket created by the stack

## üì¶ Deployment

You can deploy this stack using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or SAM/CDK.

To deploy with AWS Console:

1. Download the CloudFormation template: [`ec2-dynamic-scheduler.yaml`](./ec2-dynamic-scheduler.yaml)
2. Upload it to CloudFormation and launch the stack
3. Apply the required tags to your EC2 instances

## üìù Customization

- **Resize Target:** The off-hours instance type defaults to `t3.medium`. You can change this in the Lambda code.
- **Schedule:** Default schedule is hardcoded for Pacific Time. You can update the EventBridge cron rules if needed.
- **Logging:** CloudWatch Log Group is created with 14-day retention. Logs show success and error messages per instance.
- **Savings Reports:** Every scale-down event writes a JSON summary to the provisioned S3 bucket (`SavingsLogBucket`). You can change the bucket properties or configure lifecycle rules by editing the CloudFormation template.
- **Savings Plan Discount:** Provide your account-wide Compute Savings Plan discount (0-100%) via the `SavingsPlanDiscountPercent` parameter so savings reports reflect the discounted hourly rates instead of public On-Demand pricing.
- **CloudWatch Metrics:** Use the `SavingsMetricNamespace` parameter to control where hourly savings metrics are published. These metrics expose the total run savings and per-instance estimates, enabling dashboards, anomaly detection, or cost alerts alongside the S3 JSON reports. Set the parameter to an empty string if you prefer to disable metric publication.

## üß™ Testing

To test in the Lambda console:

1. Open the Lambda function created by the stack
2. Create a test event using this JSON format:
```json
{
  "source": "Scheduled",
  "action": "scaleup"
}
