# EC2 Dynamic Scheduler

This AWS CloudFormation stack resizes EC2 instances on a schedule to optimize compute costs for business-hours workloads. It scales instances down during off-hours and scales them back up before the next business day. This allows you to reduce spend without shutting down systems or triggering alerts from monitoring tools.

## üîß How It Works

- A Lambda function runs twice per day via EventBridge rules:
  - **7 PM Pacific (Mon‚ÄìFri only)** ‚Äî Scales down tagged instances to a smaller type (e.g. `t3.medium`)
  - **4 AM Pacific (Mon‚ÄìFri only)** ‚Äî Scales them back up to the original size
- Instances are rebooted once per resize operation (stop ‚Üí modify ‚Üí start)
- This works even if you're using Compute Savings Plans
- Minimal impact to existing tools, monitoring agents, or workflows

## üè∑Ô∏è Required EC2 Tags

Apply these tags to any EC2 instance you want managed by this scheduler:

| Tag Key                 | Tag Value            | Purpose                                           |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `DynamicInstanceScaling` | `true`               | Opts the instance into scheduling                 |
| `PreferredInstanceType`  | `m7i.large` (example) | Specifies the instance type to return to at 4 AM |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The instance type will be resized to `t3.medium` by default during off-hours.

## üîê IAM Permissions

The Lambda function follows a least privilege model. It can only modify EC2 instances with the `DynamicInstanceScaling=true` tag. It also has scoped access to:

- Start/stop/modify EC2 instances
- Create EBS volume grants (for encrypted volumes)
- Write logs to CloudWatch Logs (14-day retention)

## üì¶ Deployment

You can deploy this stack using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or SAM/CDK.

To deploy with AWS Console:

1. Download the CloudFormation template: [`ec2-dynamic-scheduler.yaml`](./ec2-dynamic-scheduler.yaml)
2. Upload it to CloudFormation and launch the stack
3. Apply the required tags to your EC2 instances

## üìù Customization

- **Resize Target:** The off-hours instance type defaults to `t3.medium`. You can change this in the Lambda code.
- **Schedule:** Default EventBridge cron rules are pinned to 4 AM and 7 PM Pacific (`cron(0 4 ? * MON-FRI *)` / `cron(0 19 ? * MON-FRI *)`). You can override the windows with the `LambdaScheduleUpTime`/`LambdaScheduleDownTime` parameters and adjust the timezone with `LambdaScheduleTimezone` (defaults to `America/Los_Angeles`).
- **Redeployment:** Deploy or update the CloudFormation stack after changing schedule parameters so the EventBridge rules pick up the new cron expressions and timezone. After the update finishes, you can confirm the timezone and cron values with:

  ```bash
  aws events describe-rule --name EC2ScalerScheduleUp --query '[ScheduleExpression, ScheduleExpressionTimezone]'
  aws events describe-rule --name EC2ScalerScheduleDown --query '[ScheduleExpression, ScheduleExpressionTimezone]'
  ```
- **Logging:** CloudWatch Log Group is created with 14-day retention. Logs show success and error messages per instance.

## üß™ Testing

To test in the Lambda console:

1. Open the Lambda function created by the stack
2. Create a test event using this JSON format:
```json
{
  "source": "Scheduled",
  "action": "scaleup"
}
